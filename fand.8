.Sh NAME
.Nm fand
.Nd daemon to control PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) cooling fans
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op options...
.Ar temperature_sensor
.Ar pwm_device
.Nm
.Op Fl s
.Op options...
.Ar temperature_sensor
.Ar pwm_device
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
daemon can be used to control a cooling fan connected to a
.Xr pwmc 4
.Ar pwm_device
based on the system temperature retrived from a
.Xr sysctl 3
.Ar temperature_sensor
. Low and high termperature thresholds can be configured, each with separate
PWM parameters.
.Pp
.Ar temperature_sensor
should be the name of the sysctl variable used to read the system temperature.
.Ar pwm_device
should be the name of the PWM device that controls the system fan. If an
unqualified name is provided,
.Pa /dev/pwm
is automatically prepended.
.Pp
When called with the
.Fl s
option,
.Nm
will print the current status of the temperature sensor and the PWM state and
exit. This can be useful when determining the required temperature multiplier
and other options.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "-t temperature"
.It Fl d Ar duty
The duty cycle (in nanoseconds or percentage) of the PWM channel for the
default (low) temperature threshold. Duty is the portion of the
.Ar period
during which the signal is asserted.
.It Fl D Ar duty
The duty cycle (in nanoseconds or percentage) of the PWM channel for the
high temperature threshold. Duty is the portion of the
.Ar period
during which the signal is asserted.
.It Fl f
Run
.Nm
in the foreground. Also enables more verbose output.
.It Fl i Ar seconds
The temperature polling interval, in seconds (Default: 60)
.It Fl I
Invert PWM signal polarity
.It Fl K
Converts the temperature sensor reading from degrees Kelvin
.It Fl m Ar multiplier
Multiplier applied to reading from temperature sensor (Default: 1.0)
.It Fl o Ar temperature
Temperature to deactivate fan, in °C (Default: 50)
.It Fl p Ar period
The period in nanoseconds of the PWM channel for the default (low) temperature
threshold (Default: 0)
.It Fl P Ar period
The period in nanoseconds of the PWM channel for the high temperature threshold
(Default: 0)
.It Fl r Ar path
The PID file path
(Default: /var/run/fand.pid)
.It Fl s
Show current temperature and PWM status, then exit.
.It Fl t Ar temperature
Default (low) temperature to enable the fan, in °C (Default: 50)
.It Fl T Ar temperature
High temperature threshold, in °C (Default: not set)
.It Fl v
Print program version and exit
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Bl -bullet
.It
Using the "hw.temp.CPU" sensor and the pwmc1.0 controller, run the fan
at half duty cycle when the temperature reaches 45C and run at full when the
temperature rises above 60C. Disable the fan if the temperature falls below
35C. When reading from the sensor, assume value is in tenth degrees Kelvin.
